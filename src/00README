version on 17th August 2005 is a copy of the working copy from mercury
and foehn.  These should be tested with an install procedure (to dummy
locations) to check they are the correct copies.  Note the model needs
installing into directories visible on mercury, while the interface
needs installing in directories visible on foehn
