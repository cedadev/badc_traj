Installation for the CGI part of the trajectory service.

As root, type:

    make install

This will install to /var/www/badc_site/cgi-bin/trajectory_test
If the directory already exists, it will fail, so remove the target
directory and try again.

Test it out in web browser at

    http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/trajectory_test/traj_form

When you are happy, clear out the live directory which is
/var/www/badc_site/cgi-bin/trajectory

and then type

    make install CGI_DIR=/cgi-bin/trajectory

and test it at
    http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/trajectory/traj_form

Please do not "correct" the Makefile in subversion to point directly to
the live directory.  This will ensure that nobody will overwrite the live
directory without first reading these instructions.
